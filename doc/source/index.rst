===========================================
Welcome to Kwapi's developer documentation!
===========================================

Kwapi is a framework designed for acquiring energy consumption metrics. It
allows to upload metrics from various wattmeters to Ceilometer.

Its architecture is based on a layer of drivers, which retrieve measurements
from wattmeters, and a layer of plugins that collect and process them. The
communication between these two layers goes through a bus. In the case of a
distributed architecture, a plugin can listen to several drivers at remote
locations.

Drivers and plugins are easily extensible to support other types of wattmeters,
and provide other services.

What is the purpose of the project and vision for it?
=====================================================

Kwapi could be used to do:
  * Energy monitoring of data centers
  * Usage-based billing
  * Efficient scheduling

It aims at supporting various wattmeters, being scalable and easily extensible.

This documentation offers information on how Kwapi works and how to contribute
to the project.
