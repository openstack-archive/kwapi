===================
Areas to Contribute
===================

Drivers
=======

Kwapi aims at supporting various wattmeters. If you have a non-supported
wattmeter, you can easily contribute by writing a new one.


Plugins
=======

Kwapi plugins process the metrics. You can contribute by writing new plugins to
bring new functionnalities.

Testing
=======

The first version of Kwapi has not yet unit tests and has not seen much
run-time in real environments. Setting up a copy of Kwapi to monitor a real
OpenStack installation or to perform some load testing would be especially
helpful.
