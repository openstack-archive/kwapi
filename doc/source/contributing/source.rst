Working with the Source
=======================

Setting up a Development Sandbox
================================

1. Set up a server or virtual machine to run OpenStack using
   devstack_.

.. _devstack: http://www.devstack.org/

2. Clone the kwapi project to the machine::

    $ cd /opt/stack
    $ git clone https://github.com/stackforge/kwapi.git
    $ cd ./kwapi

3. Once this is done, you need to setup the review process::

    $ git remote add gerrit ssh://<username>@review.openstack.org:29418/stackforge/kwapi.git

4. If you are preparing a patch, create a topic branch and switch to
   it before making any changes::

    $ git checkout -b TOPIC-BRANCH

Code Reviews
============

Kwapi uses the OpenStack review process for all code and
developer documentation contributions. Code reviews are managed
through gerrit.
